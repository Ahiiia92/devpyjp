# Django App Example
This is a Django app example in which I follow the Django documentation:  [Link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/)

## How to...
### Clone this project or Download the project
The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.

`git clone git@github.com:Ahiiia92/devpyjp.git`

or simply download the .zip file

### Run server
```unix
python manage.py runserver
```

The entry point is http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/

You'll find a basic index page with basic frontend.
You can also just copy/paste the index.html file + the static folder into your new project.

### Notes
The project was about polls questions and answer, that's why everything is following this path.

### Model
I didn't integrated your model into the project setup, the file is under `semantic_search_quora_hnswlib.py`.

I would have to spend more time on it to think about inegrating the user input => query your model and then displaying the results.

# Good luck !
